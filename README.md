# Sales-Data-Analysis-on-Jessie's-Superstore

# **Introduction**
This analysis is centered on the determination of Jessie's superstore product revenue across the united states, its regions, states and cities. Excel spreadsheet tools with be extensively used including pivot table functions and pivot chart. 

# **Activity**
1. The total revenue yield across the category
2. The total profit generated across the regions
3. The Product with the highest revenue across the sub-category
4. The Product with highest profit yield across the sub-category
5. The frequently used ship mode for the transport of products sold.
6. The sales of products across the segment
To determine the total revenue, total profit, total number of products sold and total discount issued, KPI's and Slicers where also created to streamline the visuals as desired.

# **Skills Demonstrated**
1. Data Processing
2. The use of Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
3. The use of Slicers

# **Data Processing**
The superstore dataset was first processed by adjusting the column headers to fit appropriately into the column by highlighting the entire column row, then double-clicking a section this automatically adjusted evenly to fit the column text properly. The entire data was later converted into a table format, by clicking a part of the cell, then pressing 'Ctrl A" to highlight all dataset then i pressed 'Ctrl T' to convert the data into atable set. The first row containing all the headers were also freezed by clicking on the 'Freeze panes' in the 'view ribbon' then |I selected 'freeze top row' this kept all my headers static, when I scroll up or down. Then I pressed the 'Ctrl + Down key' buttons to get to the last data column, this visualized the total number of row fiiled with dataset, while I changed the 'Ordered Date' and 'Ship Date' format to the 'DD/MM/YY' format. Below is a screenshot of the raw dataset and the cleaned dataset.

# **The use of Pivot Tables**

The first activity on my task was to determine the total revenue across the category sales column of the superstore data. This was calculated and visualized by the help of the Pivot Table tools. First I clicked on the 'insert ribbon', then selected 'Pivot tables' while one of the table cells were highlighted, this popped-up a prompt box in which I selected 'exist worksheet', as where I wanted the pivottable to be placed. Then a Pivottable fields box also popped-up with all headers of my superstore data table, then I dragged the 'Category' column to the 'row' section and the 'sales' column to the value section, the pivot table was formed then I clicked the drop down arrow on the category column to filter the sales column from 'A to z Ascending', this arranged the category values in order of the ascending value. The pivot table can be visualized on the screenshot below. 
To create a Pivotchat for the first activity (Question 1 from the below screenshot), I highlighted a cell on the pivot table formed, then clicked on 'pivotchart' on the 'insert ribbon' this provided a drop-down box with different chart tables, then I selected the column chart, A pivot chart was formed representing the  category data in bars,  I clicked on the 'chart elements' to edit the chart, by unchecking the 'primary verticals', the gridlines, the field buttons and the 'legends', I also edited the colours of the column bars, with the highest sales having a dark blue while lower values are to have light blue colours. This visualized the highest sales product in the category market. I also inserted a text-box to describe the chart. From this pivotchart it was deduced that the total revenue was generated mainly from the sales of Technology products. The pivotchart can be visualized below.

The Second activity this task was to determine the total profit yield across regions column of the superstore data. To carryout this task, I calculated the total profit using a pivottable. A cell on the cleaned superstore table was highlighted, then I clicked on the 'insert ribbon', then selected 'Pivot tables', a prompt box popped-up, in which I selected 'exist worksheet', that is where I wanted the pivottable to be placed. Then a Pivottable fields box also popped-up with all headers of my superstore data table, then I dragged the 'region' column to the 'row' section and the 'profit' column to the value section, the pivot table was formed then I clicked the drop down arrow on the region column to filter the profit column from 'A to z Ascending', this arranged the profit generated by each region in the ascending order. The pivot table can be visualized on the screenshot below. 
After creating the pivot table, a Pivotchart was formed from the same pivot table by highlighting a cell on it, then I clicked on 'pivotchart' on the 'insert ribbon' this provided a drop-down box with different chart tables, then I selected the column chart, A pivot chart was formed representing the region data in bars,  I right-clicked on the region axis to remove the field buttons, then I also right-clicked on 'chart elements' to edit the chart, by unchecking the 'primary verticals', the gridlines, and the 'legends', I also edited the colours of the column bars, with the highest profit having a dark blue while lower values are to have light blue colours. This visualized the region with the highest profit yield. I also inserted a text-box to describe the Chart. From this pivotchart we can visual the total profit across regions and the region with the highest profit yield. See the screenshot below.

To determine the product with highest revenue across sub-category. To carryout this task, I calculated the total revenue using a pivottable. Then I inserted a new Pivot tables from the 'Insert Ribbon, a prompt box popped-up, in which I selected 'exist worksheet', where I wanted the pivottable to be placed. Then a Pivottable fields box also popped-up with all headers of my superstore data table, then I dragged the 'sub-region' column to the 'row' section and the 'sales' column to the value section. This developed the summed values of all the products sold in the sub-category, then I filtered the summed sales value by right-clicked on the drop-down arrow on the sub-category section, and used the 'values filter' to produce only the 'top 5' sales values of the sub-category, I also filtered the sales column from 'A to z Ascending', this arranged the sales value of the sub-category column in an ascending order. The pivot table can be visualized on the screenshot below. 
After creating the pivot table, a Pivotchart was formed from the same pivot table by highlighting a cell on it, then I clicked on 'pivotchart' on the 'insert ribbon' this provided a drop-down box with different chart tables, then I selected the bar chart, A pivot chart was formed representing the data in bars,  I right-clicked on the chart elements to remove the primary horizontal, the field buttons, the gridlines, and the 'legends', I also edited the colours of the bars. The top 1 value having a dark blue while lower values are to have light blue colours. This visualized the sub-category product that made the highest sales. I also inserted a text-box to describe the Chart. From this pivotchart we can visual the product with the highest sales to be 'phones'. See the screenshot below.

I also inserted a text-box to describe the Chart. From this pivotchart we can visual the product with the highest profit to be 'copiers'. See the screenshot below.
