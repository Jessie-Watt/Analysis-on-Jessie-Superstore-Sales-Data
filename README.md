# **Skills Demonstrated**
Data Processing
The use of Pivot Tables
The use of Pivot Charts
The use of Slicers

# **Data Processing**
The superstore dataset was first processed by adjusting the column headers to fit appropriately into the column by highlighting the entire column row, then double-clicking a section this automatically adjusted evenly to fit the column text properly. The entire data was later converted into a table format, by clicking a part of the cell, then pressing 'Ctrl A" to highlight all dataset then i pressed 'Ctrl T' to convert the data into atable set. The first row containing all the headers were also freezed by clicking on the 'Freeze panes' in the 'view ribbon' then |I selected 'freeze top row' this kept all my headers static, when I scroll up or down. Then I pressed the 'Ctrl + Down key' buttons to get to the last data column, this visualized the total number of row fiiled with dataset, while I changed the 'Ordered Date' and 'Ship Date' format to the 'DD/MM/YY' format. Below is a screenshot of the raw dataset and the cleaned dataset.

The first activity on my task was to determine the total revenue across the category sale column of the superstore data, this calculated the revenue and also produced a visual of 'Technology' as the most purchased/sold product in Jessie's Supertore. This calculated and visualized by the help of the Pivot Table tools. First I clicked on the 'insert ribbon', then selected 'Pivot tables' while one of the table cells were highlighted, this popped-up a prompt box in which I selected 'exist worksheet', as where I wanted the pivottable to be placed. Then a Pivottable fields box also popped-up with all headers of my superstore data table, then I dragged the 'Category' column to the 'row' section and the 'sales' column to the value section, the pivot table was formed then I clicked the drop down arrow on the category column to filter the sales column from 'A to z Ascending', this arranged the category values in order of the ascending value.
