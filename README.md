# Sales-Data-Analysis-on-Jessie's-Superstore

# **Introduction**
This analysis is centered on the determination of Jessie's superstore product revenue across the united states, its regions, states and cities. Excel spreadsheet tools with be extensively used including pivot table functions and pivot chart. 

# **Activity**
1. The total revenue yield across the category
2. The total profit generated across the regions
3. The highest product revenue across the sub-category
4. The highest profit yield across the sub-category
5. The frequently used ship mode for the transport of products sold.
6. The sales of products across the segment
To determine the total revenue, total profit, total number of products sold and total discount issued, KPI's and Slicers where also created to streamline the visuals as desired.

# **Skills Demonstrated**
Data Processing
The use of Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
The use of Slicers

# **Data Processing**
The superstore dataset was first processed by adjusting the column headers to fit appropriately into the column by highlighting the entire column row, then double-clicking a section this automatically adjusted evenly to fit the column text properly. The entire data was later converted into a table format, by clicking a part of the cell, then pressing 'Ctrl A" to highlight all dataset then i pressed 'Ctrl T' to convert the data into atable set. The first row containing all the headers were also freezed by clicking on the 'Freeze panes' in the 'view ribbon' then |I selected 'freeze top row' this kept all my headers static, when I scroll up or down. Then I pressed the 'Ctrl + Down key' buttons to get to the last data column, this visualized the total number of row fiiled with dataset, while I changed the 'Ordered Date' and 'Ship Date' format to the 'DD/MM/YY' format. Below is a screenshot of the raw dataset and the cleaned dataset.

# **The use of Pivot Tables**

The first activity on my task was to determine the total revenue across the category sales column of the superstore data. This was calculated and visualized by the help of the Pivot Table tools. First I clicked on the 'insert ribbon', then selected 'Pivot tables' while one of the table cells were highlighted, this popped-up a prompt box in which I selected 'exist worksheet', as where I wanted the pivottable to be placed. Then a Pivottable fields box also popped-up with all headers of my superstore data table, then I dragged the 'Category' column to the 'row' section and the 'sales' column to the value section, the pivot table was formed then I clicked the drop down arrow on the category column to filter the sales column from 'A to z Ascending', this arranged the category values in order of the ascending value. The pivot table can be visualized on the screenshot below. 
To creat a Pivotchat for the first activity (Question 1 from the above screenshot), I highlighted a cell on the pivot table formed, then clicked on 'pivotchart' on the 'insert ribbon' this provided a drop-down box with different chart tables, then I selected the column chart, A pivot chart was formed representing the  category data in bars,  I clicked on the 'chart elements' to edit the chart, by unchecking the 'primary verticals', the gridlines, the field buttons and the 'legends', I also edited the colours of the column bars, with the highest sales having a dark blue while lower values are to have light blue colours. This visualized the highest sales product in the category market. I also inserted a text-box to describ tables. From this pivotchart it was deduced that the total revenue was generated mainly from the sales of Technology products. The pivotchart can be visualized below.

The Second activity this task was to determine the total profit yield across regions column of the superstore data. To carryout this task, I calculated the total profit using a pivottable. A cell on the cleaned superstore table was highlighted, then I clicked on the 'insert ribbon', then selected 'Pivot tables', a prompt box popped-up, in which I selected 'exist worksheet', that is where I wanted the pivottable to be placed. Then a Pivottable fields box also popped-up with all headers of my superstore data table, then I dragged the 'region' column to the 'row' section and the 'profit' column to the value section, the pivot table was formed then I clicked the drop down arrow on the region column to filter the profit column from 'A to z Ascending', this arranged the profit generated by each region in the ascending order. The pivot table can be visualized on the screenshot below.
